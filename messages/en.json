    "text": "I'm David Witten, 30 years old, living in the heart of Germany.\n\n In early 2017, I discovered my passion for software engineering when I came across Bitcoin and started learning web development. From 2018 to 2022, alongside my studies in Physical Technologies (B.Eng.), I developed numerous web applications to master modern React.js and Next.js development, as well as websites for friends and family. In 2020, I launched a SaaS platform, offering a unique cryptographic service for Bitcoin wallets.\n\nIn 2022, I began working as a Blockchain Consultant and Web Developer at SVA System Vertrieb Alexander, a leading German IT system integrator. There, I gained experience with SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity)/Digital Identities and developed several applications utilizing blockchain and advanced authentication and identity methods.\n\nI am deeply passionate about learning new technologies, working on exciting projects, and continually seeking opportunities to enhance my skills. Currently, I'm working remotely and focusing on my own projects. I'm looking forward to collaborating with new people and contributing to the tech community.\n\nI have strong communication and problem-solving skills, excellent time management, and a solid understanding of the English language. I'm also a great listener and a strong team player.\n\nIn August 2024, I finally took the step into self-employment as a freelance web developer.",
